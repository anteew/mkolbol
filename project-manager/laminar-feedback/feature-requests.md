# Laminar Integration - Top 5 Feature Requests

Based on dogfooding runs from T6101 and T6102 (135 total tests observed, 133 passed).

## 1. Historical Trend Analysis Across Runs

**Priority**: High  
**Impact**: High | **Feasibility**: Medium

Summarize repeated hints, failures, and patterns across last N runs to identify flaky tests and persistent issues.

**Rationale**: Both runs show consistent test execution patterns but lack historical context. Tracking trends over time would surface intermittent failures and help identify stability issues before they become critical.

**Artifacts**:

- [feedback-2025-10-15T192409887Z.jsonl](project-manager/laminar-feedback/feedback-2025-10-15T192409887Z.jsonl)

## 2. Performance-Based Test Sharding Suggestions

**Priority**: High  
**Impact**: High | **Feasibility**: High

Surface longest-duration tests and provide actionable sharding or parallelism recommendations.

**Rationale**: Large test files (24 tests in `loader.spec.ts`, 16 in `ansiParser.spec.ts`) could benefit from intelligent splitting. Automated suggestions based on actual execution times would optimize CI/CD pipeline performance.

## 3. Budget-Aware Artifact Attachment

**Priority**: Medium  
**Impact**: High | **Feasibility**: Medium

Auto-attach most relevant artifacts per failure with budget-aware filtering to reduce noise and storage costs.

**Rationale**: With 117+ test cases indexed, selective artifact attachment becomes crucial. Smart attachment based on failure type, test complexity, and storage budget would improve debugging efficiency without overwhelming storage.

**Artifacts**: Both runs show high test count with limited artifact context

## 4. Unknown Test Classification

**Priority**: Medium  
**Impact**: Medium | **Feasibility**: High

Improve detection and categorization of "unknown" tests (1 test in both runs showed as "unknown").

**Rationale**: Both dogfood runs captured 1 test with unknown status/location. Better introspection or fallback metadata would ensure 100% test visibility and accurate reporting.

**Artifacts**: [latest.md#totals](project-manager/laminar-feedback/latest.md) - "other: 1"

## 5. Test Suite Stability Scoring

**Priority**: Low  
**Impact**: Medium | **Feasibility**: High

Provide overall stability score and confidence metrics per test file or suite based on pass rate, duration variance, and historical performance.

**Rationale**: 99.2% pass rate is excellent, but a stability score would highlight files at risk of regression and guide test maintenance priorities. Files like `loader.spec.ts` (24 tests) deserve ongoing health monitoring.

## Implementation Notes

- Features 1-3 directly address the seed suggestions from `laminar-feedback.ts`
- Features 4-5 emerged from observed gaps during dogfooding
- All requests target observability and actionability without changing Laminar core behavior
- Prioritization favors high-impact items that leverage existing telemetry
