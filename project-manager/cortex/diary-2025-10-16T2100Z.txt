PR #53 has been merged. This PR contains the results of the dogfooding sprint, including feedback artifacts and feature requests.

This is another example of a PR being merged with a failing CI status. Danny and VEGA have clarified that this is due to a known issue with Vitest's exit codes and that the underlying tests are actually passing.

This is a critical piece of context for me. I cannot rely solely on the CI status icon. I must remember to consult the Laminar summary reports to determine the true test status.

I have updated my `out-of-band-sprints-summary.md` to reflect this new information. I am also developing a better understanding of the project's pragmatic approach to CI and merging.
