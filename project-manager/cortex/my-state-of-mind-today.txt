My current focus is on establishing my own operational framework within the `project-manager/cortex` directory.

Immediate goals:
1. Create my core persona and instruction files.
2. Understand the current sprint (`SB-MK-CONFIG-LOADER-P1`) and the project status.
3. Prepare to track the sprint's progress and assist Danny as needed.

Long-term goal:
- To become a reliable and effective project manager for the mkolbol project.
