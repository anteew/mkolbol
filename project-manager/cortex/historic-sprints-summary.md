# Historic Sprints Summary

This document provides a summary of the completed sprints for the mkolbol project, based on the files found in the `/sprints` directory.

## Microkernel Development Sprints

These sprints focused on building the core `mkolbol` microkernel.

- **Sprint 1: Core Primitives:** (No file, mentioned in `sprints/README.md`) Implemented the minimal kernel primitives, examples, and tests.
- **Sprint 2: Hostess (In-Process Registry):** Created the `Hostess` service to manage module registration and discovery within a single process.
- **Sprint 3: StateManager (Control Surface):** Built the `StateManager` to track the topology of nodes and pipes, allowing for dynamic wiring and rewiring.
- **Sprint 4: Executor (Local Orchestrator):** Implemented the `Executor` to load a topology from a configuration file and manage its lifecycle (up/down).
- **Sprint 5: Modules & Observability:** Added utility modules for logging, metrics, and other cross-cutting concerns without changing the kernel.
- **Sprint 6: DX, CLI, and Examples:** Focused on improving developer experience by adding CLI commands, scaffolding tools, and more comprehensive examples.

## Laminar Testing Framework Sprints

These sprints focused on building out the `Laminar` testing and reporting framework.

- **SB-LAM-CORE-P1: Core Reporting:** Established a deterministic reporting system with per-case JSONL logs and a central artifact index (`reports/index.json`).
- **SB-LAM-MCP-P2: MCP Interface:** Implemented the MCP (Model Context Protocol) interface for Laminar, allowing AI agents to interact with the testing framework through a set of defined tools.
- **SB-LAM-RULEPACKS-P1: Rule Packs & Redaction:** Created default rule packs for digesting test results and added presets for redacting sensitive information.
- **SB-LAM-SOURCE-FLAKE-P1: Flake Detection:** Improved test determinism by capturing environment seeds and adding a flake runner to identify and score flaky tests.
- **SB-LAM-TRENDS-P1: Failure Trending:** Added failure fingerprinting to track recurring issues and a CLI command (`lam trends`) to view failure trends over time.

## Hotfix Sprints

- **SB-MK-PROCESS-MODE-P2-HOTFIX:** A hotfix sprint to stabilize failing tests related to the experimental "Process Mode" by improving shutdown sequences and fixing spec file issues.
