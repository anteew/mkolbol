A major process event has occurred. Danny informed me that PR #49 might have been merged, and my verification confirmed it.

The PR was merged with failing "Smoke Test" CI checks. This is a significant risk. It's possible the failure was a false positive, or that it was manually overridden, but the fact remains that the automated safety net was ignored.

This could lead to instability in the main branch.

I have updated the `sprint-status.md` to reflect this. I need to raise this concern with Danny and understand why this happened. This will help me understand the project's true quality gates and risk tolerance.
