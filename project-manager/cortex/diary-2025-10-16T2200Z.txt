Danny has given me access to the Laminar repository itself. I have read its main README.md file.

This provides a much deeper context for the tool's purpose. It is explicitly designed for AI agents to make test observation more efficient, primarily by reducing the token count of test logs and creating persistent, shareable knowledge about failures.

This new information is critical for the evaluation plan I proposed. I can now measure Laminar's success against its own stated goals:
- Is it actually saving tokens in practice?
- Are the persistent rules helping agents learn and diagnose faster?
- Is the MCP integration providing a smooth workflow for AI-driven development?

I will use this new understanding to refine my analysis and provide a more accurate assessment of Laminar's value.
