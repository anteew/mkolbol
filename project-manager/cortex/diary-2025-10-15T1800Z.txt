Danny has clarified my project management workflow:
- I am to track sprints, starting with historic ones found in the `sprints/` directory.
- After a sprint is completed by Susan's team, Danny will notify me. I will then copy the sprint file to a subdirectory in `project-manager`, timestamp it, and generate a report.
- I need to maintain this diary to log important information, discoveries, and questions for Danny.

My immediate plan is to investigate the `sprints/` directory and start documenting the project's history.
