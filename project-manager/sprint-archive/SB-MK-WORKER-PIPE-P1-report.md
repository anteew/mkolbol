## 1. Sprint Summary

The sprint `SB-MK-WORKER-PIPE-P1` is **complete**. The goal was to implement a production-ready data pipe for worker-mode nodes, including backpressure and error handling.

**Outcome:**

- The project now has a `WorkerPipeAdapter` that provides a full Duplex stream over `MessagePort`.
- The Executor has been wired to use this new adapter for worker-mode nodes.
- Unit and integration tests have been added to verify the new functionality.
- A new documentation file, `worker-mode.md`, has been created.

## 3. Questions for Danny

1.  **Pull Request Timing:** Since the `ampcode.log` shows the sprint as complete, I expected to see a pull request for this work. Is there usually a delay between the completion of the agent work and the creation of the PR? Understanding this timing will help me provide more accurate status reports.

## 4. Next Steps

- Await the creation of the pull request for this sprint.
