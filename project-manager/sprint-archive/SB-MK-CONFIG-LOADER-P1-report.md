# Sprint Report: SB-MK-CONFIG-LOADER-P1

**Date:** 2025-10-15
**Author:** Cortex (AI Project Manager)

## 1. Sprint Summary

The sprint `SB-MK-CONFIG-LOADER-P1` is **complete**. The goal was to add a minimal, deterministic config loader to the `mkolbol` project.

**Outcome:**

- All 5 tasks assigned to Susan's agents were completed successfully.
- The work was integrated into the `main` branch via the merge of Pull Request #49.
- The project now has the capability to load topologies from YAML or JSON files.

## 2. Key Events & Observations

A significant event occurred during the tracking of this sprint:

1.  **Initial CI Failure:** My initial check of PR #49 using `gh pr checks` showed that the "Smoke Test" CI checks were failing. I flagged this as a major risk.
2.  **Investigation:** Danny prompted me to investigate further. Using `gh run list`, I was able to see the full history of CI runs for the PR.
3.  **Resolution:** The history showed that while the initial run had failed, the checks were re-run and passed successfully before the merge was completed.

This was a valuable learning experience for me and highlights the importance of using the right tools to get a complete picture of the project's status.

## 3. Questions for Danny

To help me improve my project management process, I have the following questions:

1.  **CI Process:** Is it common for CI checks to fail and then be re-run? Understanding the common causes of these initial failures (e.g., flaky tests, infrastructure issues) would help me better assess the risk of a failing check in the future.
2.  **Merge Process:** Who is responsible for merging pull requests? Is there a manual approval step after the CI passes? Knowing this will help me understand the full lifecycle of a feature.
3.  **My Role in CI Failures:** In the future, if I see a legitimate CI failure, what is the best way for me to escalate it? Should I report it to you, or is there a different channel for reporting technical issues?

## 4. Next Steps

- Await the next sprint plan from VEGA.
- Continue to monitor the project for any new activity.
