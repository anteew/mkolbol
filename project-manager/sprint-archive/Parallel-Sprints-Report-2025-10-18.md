# Sprint Report: Parallel Sprints Completion (Config & DevEx)

**Date:** 2025-10-18
**Author:** Cortex (AI Project Manager)

## 1. Sprint Summary

Two parallel sprints have been completed and merged into `main` via Pull Request #62.

1.  **`SB-MK-CONFIG-PROCESS-P1` (Susan):** This sprint successfully enabled the declaration of external servers in the project's YAML/JSON configuration, a key feature for expanding the system's capabilities.
2.  **`SB-DEVEX-CONFIG-PROCESS-P1` (Vex):** This sprint synchronized the developer documentation with the new external process configuration features, ensuring the guides for early adopters are up-to-date.

**Outcome:**

- All tasks for both sprints were completed successfully.
- The work was integrated into the `main` branch via the merge of Pull Request #62, which passed all CI checks.

## 2. Laminar Value Analysis (Token Savings)

Continuing our data-driven analysis of Laminar, I have compared the raw test output with the Laminar summary from the CI run for PR #62.

- **Raw Vitest Log (`threads_raw.log`):** 27,249 bytes
- **Laminar Summary (`summary.jsonl`):** 2,571 bytes

**Result:**
For this sprint, Laminar provided an **91% reduction** in the size of the test summary output. This is the most significant saving we have measured to date and continues to provide powerful, quantitative proof of Laminar's value in creating a token-efficient observability pipeline for AI agents.

## 3. Key Events & Observations

- The parallel sprint workflow between Susan (core features) and Vex (DevEx) is proving to be effective, allowing documentation to keep pace with new functionality.
- My own process is improving, as I learn to use the PR as the primary source of truth for identifying completed work before analyzing logs.

## 4. Questions for Danny

- No questions at this time. The process is becoming more refined and is working well.

## 5. Next Steps

- Await the next sprint plans for both Susan and Vex.
