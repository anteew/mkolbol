# Sprint Report: SB-MK-PROCESS-MODE-ENFORCE-P1

**Date:** 2025-10-17
**Author:** Cortex (AI Project Manager)

## 1. Sprint Summary

The sprint `SB-MK-PROCESS-MODE-ENFORCE-P1` is **complete**. The goal was to stabilize the `process-mode` tests and make them a required, blocking step in the CI pipeline.

**Outcome:**

- All 5 tasks assigned to Susan's agents were completed successfully.
- The work was integrated into the `main` branch via the merge of Pull Request #59.
- The CI pipeline is now stricter, with the `forks` lane (which includes `process-mode` tests) being a required check.

## 2. Laminar Value Analysis (Token Savings)

Continuing our data-driven analysis of Laminar, I have compared the raw test output with the Laminar summary from the CI run for PR #59.

- **Raw Vitest Log (`threads_raw.log`):** 19,340 bytes
- **Laminar Summary (`summary.jsonl`):** 2,566 bytes

**Result:**
For this sprint, Laminar provided an **87% reduction** in the size of the test summary output. This result is consistent with the previous sprint and provides another strong data point for Laminar's value in reducing the token footprint for AI agent consumption.

## 3. Project Status Assessment

With the completion of this sprint, the core infrastructure of the `mkolbol` project is becoming increasingly robust. The key pieces are:

- A minimal, functional microkernel.
- A growing suite of modules (parser, process/worker adapters).
- A stable and strict CI/CD pipeline.
- A powerful, data-driven test observability tool (Laminar).

Based on the official roadmap, we have largely completed **Phase 1: Core Kernel**. The recent work on the ANSI parser also represents a strong start on **Phase 2: Parsers & Renderers**.

## 4. Prediction for Next Sprint

Given the current status and the project roadmap (`docs/rfcs/stream-kernel/09-roadmap.md`), my prediction for the next sprint is that it will focus on the remaining items in **Phase 2: Parsers & Renderers**.

Specifically, I expect the next sprint to involve the creation of one or more **renderer modules**, such as:

- `CanvasRenderer`: To render terminal output to an HTML5 canvas.
- `XtermJSRenderer`: To integrate with the popular `xterm.js` library for a web-based terminal.

This would be the logical next step, as it would allow us to visualize the output of the newly created `AnsiParser` module, providing a complete end-to-end data flow from a PTY source to a rendered visual output.

This report is based on the archived log file: `SB-MK-PROCESS-MODE-ENFORCE-P1-2025-10-17.log`.
