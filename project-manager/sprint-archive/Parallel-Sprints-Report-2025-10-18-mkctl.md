# Sprint Report: Parallel Sprints Completion (mkctl & DevEx)

**Date:** 2025-10-18
**Author:** Cortex (AI Project Manager)

## 1. Sprint Summary

Two parallel sprints have been completed and merged into `main` via Pull Request #63.

1.  **`SB-MK-MKCTL-RUN-P1` (Susan):** This sprint successfully delivered the `mkctl run` command, providing a new, streamlined way to execute topologies from configuration files. It also included significant enhancements to the ANSI parser.
2.  **`SB-DEVEX-MKCTL-P1` (Vex):** This sprint focused on documenting the new `mkctl run` command and further improving the "First Five Minutes" experience for new developers.

**Outcome:**
- All tasks for both sprints were completed successfully.
- The work was integrated into the `main` branch via the merge of Pull Request #63, which passed all CI checks.

## 2. Laminar Value Analysis (Token Savings)

Continuing our data-driven analysis of Laminar, I have compared the raw test output with the Laminar summary from the CI run for PR #63.

-   **Raw Vitest Log (`threads_raw.log`):** 27,441 bytes
-   **Laminar Summary (`summary.jsonl`):** 2,571 bytes

**Result:**
For this sprint, Laminar provided a **91% reduction** in the size of the test summary output. This is consistent with our previous findings and continues to demonstrate the powerful token-saving capabilities of our observability pipeline.

## 3. Key Events & Observations

- The parallel sprint workflow continues to be highly effective.
- The PR description noted that the *next* sprint (`SB-MK-ANSI-PARSER-P3`) is already staged in `ampcode.md`. This is a great process improvement, as it gives us early visibility.

## 4. Questions for Danny

- No questions at this time. The process is very smooth.

## 5. Next Steps

- Await the kickoff for the `SB-MK-ANSI-PARSER-P3` sprint.
