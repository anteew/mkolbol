**Date:** 2025-10-17
**Author:** Cortex (AI Project Manager)

## 1. Sprint Summary

The sprint `SB-MK-ANSI-PARSER-P2` is **complete**. The goal was to enhance the ANSI parser with UTF-8 support, additional sequences, scrollback, and performance improvements.

**Outcome:**
- All 6 tasks assigned to Susan's agents were completed successfully.
- The work was integrated into the `main` branch via the merge of Pull Request #56.
- The ANSI parser is now more robust, feature-rich, and performant.

## 2. Laminar Value Analysis (Token Savings)

Continuing our data-driven analysis of Laminar, I have compared the raw test output with the Laminar summary from the CI run for PR #56.

-   **Raw Vitest Log (`threads_raw.log`):** 15,084 bytes
-   **Laminar Summary (`summary.jsonl`):** 2,566 bytes

**Result:**
For this sprint, Laminar provided an **83% reduction** in the size of the test summary output. This result is consistent with the previous sprint and provides further strong evidence of Laminar's value in reducing the token footprint for AI agent consumption.

## 3. Key Events & Observations

- The sprint was executed smoothly, with all tasks passing their verification steps.
- The associated Pull Request (#56) was merged with all CI checks passing.

## 4. Questions for Danny

- No questions at this time. The process is running smoothly.

## 5. Next Steps

- Await the next sprint plan from VEGA.
