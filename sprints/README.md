# Stream Kernel Roadmap Sprints

This directory contains the sprint plans for evolving the stream-based microkernel from local-only POC to a more complete system.

- Sprint 1: Minimal kernel primitives, examples, tests (implemented in PR #3)
- Sprint 2: Hostess (In-Process Registry)
- Sprint 3: StateManager (Control Surface / Topology)
- Sprint 4: Executor (Local Orchestrator)
- Sprint 5: Modules + Observability
- Sprint 6: DX/CLI/Examples

Each sprint file outlines scope, stories, deliverables, out of scope, and demo checklist.
