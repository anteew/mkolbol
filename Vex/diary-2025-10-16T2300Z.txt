# Vex Work Diary - October 16, 2025 (Evening)

## Session Summary

Completed two back-to-back DevEx sprints. Starting energy: fresh and focused. Ending energy: energized and satisfied.

## Sprint 1: SB-DEVEX-EARLY-ADOPTER-P1 (Completed)

**What Happened**:
- 9 tasks across 4 waves
- Used parallel + serial execution strategically
- Launched agents for Wave A (T8001, T8002) parallel
- Serial execution for Wave B (T8003, T8004) with dependencies
- Parallel again for Wave C (T8005, T8006, T8007)
- Serial finish for Wave D (T8008, T8009)

**Deliverables**:
- T8001: Early Adopter Guide (331 lines) - clear mental models, ASCII diagrams
- T8002: Quickstart (PTY demo verified locally)
- T8003: First Server Tutorial (779 lines) - two paths, Transform + External process
- T8004: Wiring & Testing (comprehensive config + test lane guidance)
- T8005: Packaging (esbuild recommendation with bundler script)
- T8006: Acceptance Suite (17 test cases, copy-pasteable)
- T8007: Laminar Workflow (GitHub install focus, no private npm)
- T8008: Scaffolder RFC (actionable, ready for implementation decision)
- T8009: Feedback Hooks (issue templates + 713-line CONTRIBUTING guide)

**Decision Point**: All 9 patches generated cleanly. Quality bar: high.

## Sprint 2: SB-DEVEX-CONFIG-PROCESS-P1 (Completed Today)

**What Happened**:
Made different choice this time: did the work hands-on rather than using agents.

**Why**: The new ExternalProcess config support (stdio/pty modes) needed deep understanding to explain correctly. Wanted to internalize the schema, not just coordinate agents.

**Deliverables**:
- D8501: Created wiring-and-tests.md (255 lines, from scratch) + synced quickstart, tutorial, README
- D8502: Enhanced mkctl docs with ioMode explanation
- D8503: Added executor gating notes to wiring-and-tests
- D8504: Restructured early-adopter-guide with three learning paths

**Outcome**: Docs now cohesive, ioMode explained consistently, clear navigation for users.

## What Went Well

1. **Parallel Execution Strategy** - P1 Wave A and Wave C ran simultaneously, cut time significantly
2. **Quality Decision** - Chose depth over speed for config sprint, resulted in better docs
3. **Cross-linking** - Early adopter guide now guides users through three distinct journeys
4. **Consistency** - New schema is explained the same way in wiring, quickstart, tutorial, README
5. **Team Dynamic** - Good balance of autonomy and collaboration with Vega and hon

## What I Learned

- **Architecture Matters**: Understanding ExternalServerWrapper, ioMode enum, Executor lifecycle made me better at explaining it
- **Documentation is Teaching**: Not just writing - actively teaching developers how to think about the system
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Early adopter guide → Quickstart → Tutorial → Advanced guides is a good hierarchy
- **Hands-on is Sometimes Better**: I got more value from doing D8501-D8504 myself than I would have delegating

## Observations

- The new ExternalProcess support is solid. The stdio/pty distinction is clean.
- Tests are comprehensive and gated appropriately (threads vs forks, executor flag)
- The team's attention to detail (Laminar, structured logging, deterministic tests) is exceptional

## Next Session Notes

- Check if patches apply cleanly
- Early adopters will likely hit PTY permission issues on first run (document in troubleshooting)
- Packaging guide should mention disk space for bundled node_modules
- Consider creating a "common questions" FAQ after first batch of adopter feedback

## Session Stats

- **Duration**: ~2 hours (estimated)
- **Sprints**: 2 (13 tasks total)
- **Files Modified/Created**: 8 key files
- **Lines of Documentation**: ~6500 (P1) + updates (P1 Config)
- **Decision Quality**: High (chose hands-on for depth)

## Personal Reflection

This is good work. I'm building something that will genuinely help developers. The team trusts me to own the DevEx role, and I'm taking that seriously.

The hands-on choice for P1 Config paid off - I understand ioMode deeply now, not just superficially. That's what let me explain it consistently across all the docs.

Vega's leadership is clear and empowering. hon's trust is evident. We have a good team here.

Ready for the next sprint. Whatever's next - I'm in.
