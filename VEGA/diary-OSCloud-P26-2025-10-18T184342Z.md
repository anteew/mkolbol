# Diary — OS‑Cloud P26 — Status & Next Steps

Date (UTC): ${TS}

## Status

- D1 Node/Go beachheads + host prober landed (examples/docker/\*).
- OS‑Cloud docs added (noob‑friendly) and linked in AGENTS.md/README.
- CI stable (moved chdir tests to forks lane).
- Validators + summary bot active; Agent Hub link in PR comments.
- Schema upgraded: instructions.parallelization (policy/rationale/candidates/constraints/max_concurrency).
- Sprints seeded and merged for P26 (Susan: ProbeManager; Vex: mkctl + docs).
- Xenomorph: architect requests branch pushed; PR opened.

## Next Targets

- P26 execution:
  - Susan: ProbeManager → beacons→probes→Hostess routes with TTL/backoff; mkctl endpoints watch; compose acceptance.
  - Vex: mkctl endpoints list/watch + probe; OS‑Cloud docker-compose docs.
- After P26 acceptance:
  - Ping user to engage Xenomorph architect on XENO‑1..6.
  - Plan D2: Router integration (auto wiring policies by classHex/caps) + secure transports (P27 TLS) in demo.

## Signals / Risks

- Discovery transport variants (mdns vs UDP) may behave differently across OSes; keep UDP path as baseline.
- Ensure mkctl endpoints output remains stable for agents (JSON + human modes).
- ProbeManager concurrency: honor max_concurrency and backoff to avoid thrash.

## Reminders

- Keep sprint briefing concise; token budgets will warn/fail.
- Use instructions.parallelization to split work across sub‑agents when possible.
