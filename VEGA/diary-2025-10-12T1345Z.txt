Context
- Completed SB-CTRL-ISOLATION-P1: introduced ControlBus/Pipe adapters, worker-mode harness, and mixed-mode demo. Kernel stayed tiny.
- Executor now supports runMode 'worker' (MessagePort adapters) and registers in-proc/worker servers with Hostess. Control loop demo and worker demo both run.

Highlights
- ControlBusAdapter + InProc/Worker adapters; PipeAdapter + InProc/Worker pipes.
- Worker harness publishes control.hello; Executor awaits worker.ready before wiring.
- Mixed-mode topology runs: timer → upper(worker) → sink(inproc) and timer → upper(inproc) → sink(worker).

Edge notes
- Vitest worker tests present, but tinypool under Node 24 is flaky here; will set runner flags or single-thread mode in CI.
- Worker shutdown reports exit code 1 on terminate; cosmetic follow-up to exit 0 after graceful stop.

Next
- Hostess control endpoints in guest book (type + coordinates) so tools know how to talk to any server.
- Process-mode adapters (Unix/TCP) with blue/green cutover, after endpoints land.
- Optional: NATS adapter later; keep in-proc default for demos.

Vibe
- Steady and surgical. Kernel remains plumbing; controllers/adapters carry the complexity. Favor small, testable increments with runnable demos.
