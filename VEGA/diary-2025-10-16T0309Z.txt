Branch & SHA
- Branch: mkolbol-devex-p5
- HEAD: 3ed9de7

What I did now
- Pulled main (PR #64 is merged) and created branch mkolbol-devex-p5.
- Rotated ampcode.md for Susan: SB-MK-DEVEX-P5 (mkctl ergonomics + ANSI Parser P3 polish).
- Added DEVEX-P5 (Vex) tasks to devex.md: First Five Minutes landing, troubleshooting, packaging walkthrough.

Next
- Commit and push branch.
- Hand off to Susan (ampcode.md) and Vex (devex.md).
- Keep kernel inert; focus on CLI/docs/tests.
