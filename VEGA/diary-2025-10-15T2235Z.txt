Summary
- Merged: ANSI Parser P1 (#55), ANSI Parser P2 (#56), CI Stabilize P1 (#57), Digest Generator P1 (#58).
- CI now captures both Laminar artifacts and raw vitest logs for ROI comparisons.
- Digest suite re‑enabled in threads lane (generator + rulepacks + redaction landed).

What changed today
- Parser fidelity: UTF‑8/wide chars, extra CSI/RIS, scrollback/snapshots.
- CI discipline: dual reporters → strict where sensible; process‑mode kept as monitored step.
- Digest: minimal generator + node-defaults rulepack + redaction stub; tests green.

Next
- Compact context; rehydrate instructions updated.
- Choose next sprint: (a) Process‑mode enforcement to required, or (b) Packaging/Quickstart + docs polish. Leaning (a) if CI remains green across runs; otherwise (b).
