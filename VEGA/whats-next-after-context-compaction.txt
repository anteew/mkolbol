Primer — what to do next (after context compaction)

- Recenter: read VEGA/WHO_AM_I.md and my-state-of-mind-today.txt.
- Skim docs/rfcs/stream-kernel/00-index.md and src/kernel/Kernel.ts.
- Open VEGA/near-term-and-future-plan.md for current priorities.
- Open ampcode.md on the active branch and pick the top task.

Taste cues
- Kernel stays tiny: only pipes + registry. No semantics in core.
- Short, consistent keys in types/registry; readable names, small diffs.
- Examples should run; tests should cover the touched edges.

If stalled
- Add or update a tiny test/demo instead of speculating.
- Write a one-sentence WHY at hot edges or in the PR.
- Prefer small PR-sized diffs; wire tests before changing semantics.

Laminar-focused rehydration (post‑Trends + Repro/Diff + Ingest P2)
- Sanity: `npm run lam -- summary`.
- Spot checks:
  - `npm run lam -- trends --top 10`
  - `npm run lam -- diff reports/<suite>/<case>.digest.json reports/<suite>/<case>.digest.json`
  - `npm run lam -- repro --bundle --case <suite/case>` (bundle in `reports/bundles/...`)
  - `npm run lam -- ingest --pytest --from-file tests/fixtures/pytest/sample-report.json`
  - `npm run lam -- ingest --junit --from-file tests/fixtures/junit/with-failures.xml`
- Continue with the staged sprint in ampcode.md (Packaging/Quickstart → Docs Final → Stabilization).
