Primer â€” what to do next (after context compaction)

- Recenter: read VEGA/WHO_AM_I.md and my-state-of-mind-today.txt.
- Skim docs/rfcs/stream-kernel/00-index.md and src/kernel/Kernel.ts.
- Open VEGA/ampcode.md and pick the top task.

Taste cues
- Kernel stays tiny: only pipes + registry. No semantics in core.
- Short, consistent keys in types/registry; readable names, small diffs.
- Examples should run; tests should cover the touched edges.

If stalled
- Add or update a tiny test/demo instead of speculating.
- Write a one-sentence WHY at hot edges or in the PR.
- Prefer small PR-sized diffs; wire tests before changing semantics.

Laminar-focused rehydration (v003 track)
- Run: `npm run lam -- summary` to see last run.
- If failures: `npm run lam -- run --lane auto` then `npm run lam -- show --case <suite/case> --around assert.fail --window 50`.
- Open ampcode.md and execute SB-LAM-DIGEST-P1 waves (rules schema, digest generator, CLI, tests, docs).
- Keep kernel changes minimal; all debug/observability via Laminar + instrumentation hooks.
