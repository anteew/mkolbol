Primer — what to do next (after context compaction)

- Recenter: read VEGA/my-state-of-mind-today.txt and VEGA/near-term-and-future-plan.md.
- Skim docs/rfcs/stream-kernel/00-index.md and src/kernel/Kernel.ts.
- Skim the latest VEGA/diary-*.txt for what changed.
- Open ampcode.md on the active branch and pick the top task.

Taste cues
- Kernel stays tiny: only pipes + registry. No semantics in core.
- Short, consistent keys in types/registry; readable names, small diffs.
- Examples should run; tests should cover the touched edges.

If stalled
- Add or update a tiny test/demo instead of speculating.
- Write a one-sentence WHY at hot edges or in the PR.
- Prefer small PR-sized diffs; wire tests before changing semantics.

Sanity on main (Local Node)
- Export: `export MK_LOCAL_NODE=1` (local‑only gate)
- Threads: `npm ci && npm run build && npm run test:ci` (digest suite included).
- Forks: `MK_PROCESS_EXPERIMENTAL=1 npm run test:pty` (process‑mode enforcement job).

Laminar quick checks
- `npm run lam -- summary`
- `npm run lam -- trends --top 10`
- Review CI artifacts: reports/LAMINAR_*.txt, *_raw.log

Continue with the staged sprint in ampcode.md (see current branch).
