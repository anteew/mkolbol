Primer â€” what to do next (after context compaction)

- Recenter: read VEGA/WHO_AM_I.md and my-state-of-mind-today.txt.
- Skim docs/rfcs/stream-kernel/00-index.md and src/kernel/Kernel.ts.
- Open VEGA/ampcode.md and pick the top task.

Taste cues
- Kernel stays tiny: only pipes + registry. No semantics in core.
- Short, consistent keys in types/registry; readable names, small diffs.
- Examples should run; tests should cover the touched edges.

If stalled
- Add or update a tiny test/demo instead of speculating.
- Write a one-sentence WHY at hot edges or in the PR.
- Prefer small PR-sized diffs; wire tests before changing semantics.
