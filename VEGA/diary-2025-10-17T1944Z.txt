# VEGA Diary — P18 merged and P19 lint kickoff

What changed
- P18A (TCP) and P18B (WebSocket) merged to main. Local build/tests green.
- Created branch mkolbol-devex-p19-lint-cleanup for Vex to reduce lint noise.
- Rotated ampcode.log to archives/ to speed up agents reading logs.

Next
- Vex: run the P19-LINT sprint in devex.md on the p19 branch.
- After lint debt reduction, we’ll plan mkctl --connect tcp:// / ws://.
