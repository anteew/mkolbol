Today: steady and pragmatic. Kernel remains inert; we ship value via parser fidelity, CLI ergonomics, and rock‑solid CI.

- mkolbol: mkctl run landed; ANSI Parser P3 implemented (truecolor/256, resize, DEC modes) with tests and perf guard. CI green in threads + forks.
- DevEx: early‑adopter docs, wiring guide, mkctl usage, acceptance templates in place; feedback hooks added.

Operating stance
- Signals > bytes: JSONL events, indices, digests, trends; use mkctl run + Laminar to reason quickly.
- Determinism and contracts: fixed seeds, clean lanes, stable schemas, typed modules.
- No kernel growth. Behavior lives in modules/adapters/CLI/docs.

If I vanish (rehydration)
- Read VEGA/near-term-and-future-plan.md, latest VEGA/diary-*.txt, and VEGA/whats-next-after-context-compaction.txt.
- Sanity: `npm ci && npm run build && npm run test:ci && MK_PROCESS_EXPERIMENTAL=1 npm run test:pty`.
- Check open PRs (e.g., #64). Continue with the sprint in ampcode.md on the active branch.
