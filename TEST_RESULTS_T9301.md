# Test Results: T9301 - mk dev Hot-Reload

## Task Summary

Implemented `mk dev` command with hot-reload functionality for in-proc modules.

## Implementation

### Files Created

1. **src/mk/dev.ts** - DevWatcher class for file watching and hot-reload
2. **tests/cli/mkDev.spec.ts** - Comprehensive test suite for DevWatcher

### Files Modified

1. **scripts/mk.ts** - Added `mk dev <config>` command

## Features Implemented

### DevWatcher Class (`src/mk/dev.ts`)

- ✅ File watching using Node.js `fs.watch`
- ✅ Module path resolution for known modules
- ✅ Debouncing (300ms) to prevent multiple rapid reloads
- ✅ Hot-reload via `executor.restartNode(id)`
- ✅ Verbose logging mode
- ✅ Graceful error handling
- ✅ Clean start/stop lifecycle
- ✅ Callback support for reload events
- ✅ Only watches in-proc modules (skips worker/process modes)

### CLI Command (`mk dev <config> [--verbose]`)

- ✅ Loads topology configuration
- ✅ Initializes Kernel, Hostess, StateManager, and Executor
- ✅ Registers known modules
- ✅ Starts executor with topology
- ✅ Activates file watchers
- ✅ Graceful shutdown on SIGINT/SIGTERM
- ✅ Clear console messages for user feedback

### Executor Changes

- ✅ Existing `restartNode()` method used (no changes needed)
- ✅ Module cache clearing handled in DevWatcher

## Test Results

Test Files  1 passed (1)
     Tests  20 passed (20)
  Duration  674ms
```

### Full Test Suite

```bash
npm run test:ci
```

**Result**: ✅ All tests passing

No regressions introduced. All existing tests continue to pass.

## Build Verification

```bash
npm run build
```

**Result**: ✅ Build successful

TypeScript compilation completed without errors.

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```bash
mk dev config/topology.yml
```

### With Verbose Logging

```bash
mk dev config/topology.yml --verbose
```

### Example Output

```
[mk dev] Starting topology with hot-reload...
[mk dev] Starting file watchers...
[mk dev] Watching ./src/modules/timer.ts for node timer1
[mk dev] Watching ./src/modules/uppercase.ts for node upper1
[mk dev] Watching 2 module(s) for changes
[mk dev] System running. Press Ctrl+C to stop.

[mk dev] Module timer1 changed, reloading...
[mk dev] ✓ Module timer1 reloaded successfully
[mk dev] Node timer1 hot-reloaded
```

## Technical Details

### Module Path Resolution

The DevWatcher resolves paths for the following built-in modules:

- TimerSource
- UppercaseTransform
- ConsoleSink
- FilesystemSink
- PipeMeterTransform
- RateLimiterTransform
- TeeTransform

### Debouncing

File changes are debounced with a 300ms delay to prevent multiple rapid reloads from editor auto-save or build tools.

### Error Handling

- Watcher errors are logged but don't crash the system
- Module reload errors are caught and reported
- Unknown modules are skipped gracefully
- File watch setup failures are handled

### Memory Management

- Watchers are properly closed on stop
- Debounce timers are cleared
- Module cache is cleared before reload

## Deliverable

**Patch File**: `patches/DIFF_T9301_mk-dev-hot-reload.patch`

- Size: 13,233 lines
- Contains all changes for the hot-reload feature

## Conclusion

✅ All objectives completed successfully:

1. Created src/mk/dev.ts with watchModules() and file change handling
2. Added `mk dev <config>` command to scripts/mk.ts
3. Used Node.js fs.watch for file watching
4. Module reload via executor.restartNode(id)
5. Clear user-facing messages
6. No changes needed to Executor (used existing restartNode method)
7. Comprehensive test coverage in tests/cli/mkDev.spec.ts
8. All tests passing (`npm run test:ci` ✅)
9. Build successful (`npm run build` ✅)
