# T2604: Comprehensive Tests for Flake Detection and Code Frames

## Summary

Created comprehensive test suite for stability scoring, flake detection, seed/environment capture, and code frame extraction functionality.

## Files Created

- **tests/digest/flakeAndFrames.spec.ts**: 934 lines of comprehensive tests

## Test Coverage

### 1. Flake Classification (16 tests)

#### Stability Scoring
- ✅ Calculates 100% stability for always-passing tests
- ✅ Calculates 0% stability for always-failing tests  
- ✅ Calculates partial stability for flaky tests (e.g., 60% for 3/5 passes)
- ✅ Handles edge cases (single run, 1/10 passes, 9/10 passes)

#### Classification Logic
- ✅ Stable tests: score === 100
- ✅ Flaky tests: 0 < score < 100
- ✅ Always-fail tests: score === 0

#### Stability Tracking
- ✅ Tracks multiple tests independently
- ✅ Increments run counts correctly
- ✅ Sorts tests by score (flakiest first)
- ✅ Filters tests by classification category

### 2. Seed and Environment Capture (6 tests)

- ✅ Captures test seed in artifacts
- ✅ Captures environment variables (TEST_SEED, CI, LAMINAR_DEBUG, etc.)
- ✅ Stores platform information (Node version, OS, arch)
- ✅ Uses fixed seed (42) for deterministic flake detection
- ✅ Includes seed across multiple runs for reproducibility
- ✅ Captures only relevant environment variables

### 3. Code Frame Extraction (25 tests)

#### Stack Trace Parsing
- ✅ Parses Node.js stack trace format: `at function (file:line:col)`
- ✅ Parses V8 format without function names: `at file:line:col`
- ✅ Parses Firefox-style: `func@file:line:col`
- ✅ Handles empty stack traces
- ✅ Skips unparseable lines
- ✅ Extracts file paths, line/column numbers correctly

#### Code Frame Extraction from Files
- ✅ Extracts code frames with configurable context lines (default: 2)
- ✅ Handles first line of file (0 before lines)
- ✅ Handles last line of file (0 after lines)
- ✅ Returns null for non-existent files
- ✅ Returns null for out-of-range line numbers
- ✅ Includes correct line numbers in source array

#### Sourcemap Resolution
- ✅ Resolves .ts file when .js.map exists
- ✅ Falls back to .ts file if sourcemap doesn't exist
- ✅ Returns original file if neither sourcemap nor .ts exists
- ✅ Caches sourcemaps for repeated access

#### Code Frame Formatting
- ✅ Formats with line numbers and file location
- ✅ Includes column indicator (^) when column specified
- ✅ Omits column indicator when not specified
- ✅ Pads line numbers correctly for alignment

#### Full Stack Extraction
- ✅ Extracts code frames from full stack traces
- ✅ Limits to maximum 3 code frames per stack
- ✅ Skips frames without file/line information

### 4. Code Frame Budget Enforcement (5 tests)

- ✅ Limits number of code frames to 5 total
- ✅ Includes code frames in budget calculation
- ✅ Extracts code frames only when configured in rules
- ✅ Extracts only from error-level events with stack traces
- ✅ Respects contextLines configuration in codeframe action

## Key Implementation Details

### Flake Detection Algorithm
Tests verify the algorithm implemented in `scripts/laminar-run.ts`:
- Runs tests N times (default: 5) with fixed seed (42)
- Tracks pass/fail counts per test location
- Calculates stability score: `(passes / runs) * 100`
- Classifies as stable (100%), flaky (0-100%), or always-fail (0%)

### Seed & Environment Tracking
Tests verify the capture mechanism in `src/test/reporter/jsonlReporter.ts`:
- Fixed seed (42) used for reproducibility
- Environment variables captured: CI, NODE_ENV, TEST_SEED, LAMINAR_DEBUG
- Platform info: Node version, OS, architecture
- Stored in case.begin events and index.json

### Code Frame Architecture
Tests verify the implementation in `src/digest/codeframe.ts`:
- `CodeFrameExtractor` class with configurable context lines
- Multiple stack trace format support (Node.js, V8, Firefox)
- Sourcemap resolution with caching
- Budget enforcement (max 5 frames per digest)

## Verification

```bash
npm run test:ci || true
# Result: All 52 new tests pass
# Total test suite: 189 tests, 188 passing, 1 unrelated failure
```

## Integration

The tests integrate with existing digest and flake detection systems:
- Compatible with `DigestGenerator` and `DigestConfig` types
- Tests actual `CodeFrameExtractor` implementation
- Validates flake detection logic from `laminar-run.ts`
- Verifies seed/env capture from `jsonlReporter.ts`

## Future Enhancements

While comprehensive, these tests could be extended to cover:
- Integration tests with actual flaky tests
- Performance tests for large stack traces
- Advanced sourcemap scenarios (multiple sources, embedded sourcemaps)
- Code frame rendering with syntax highlighting
- Flake detection with varying reruns (3, 10, 20 runs)
