+# Archives Directory
+
+This directory is used for storing archived files that are too large or infrequently accessed to keep in the main workspace.
+
+## Log Rotation
+
+Heavy log files should be rotated to this directory to keep the repository clean:
+
+- Move large log files (>1MB or older than 7 days) to `archives/`
+- Use timestamped filenames: `{filename}.{timestamp}.{ext}`
+- Example: `ampcode.log.2025-10-17T194426Z`
+
+## Git Ignore
+
+This directory is included in `.prettierignore` to skip formatting checks on archived content.
+
+## Cleanup
+
+Periodically review and remove old archived files that are no longer needed.
