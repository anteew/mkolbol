# T7001: Add --json flag and metadata.* filtering to mkctl endpoints
# Status: ALREADY IMPLEMENTED IN T6001
#
# This task is a duplicate of T6001 (patches/DIFF_T6001_mkctl-endpoints-json.patch)
# which already added:
# - --json flag for JSON output format
# - metadata.* filtering support (e.g., --filter metadata.module=Timer)
# - Tests for both features
#
# No additional changes required.
