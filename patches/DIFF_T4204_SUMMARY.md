# T4204 Documentation Summary: Rule Packs, Redaction, Budgets & Overlays

## Added Sections

### 1. Rule Packs (## Rule Packs - line 4070)

**Documented:**
- All three built-in rule packs: `node-defaults`, `go-defaults`, `minimal`
- Full JSON configurations for each pack
- When to use each pack (comparison table)
- Customization examples
- Best practices for pack selection

**Key Content:**
- `node-defaults`: For Node.js/TS tests with worker support
- `go-defaults`: For Go test ingestion with cleanup phases
- `minimal`: For token-constrained CI environments
- Practical customization example adding redaction

### 2. Redaction (## Redaction - line 4245)

**Documented:**
- How redaction works (field replacement with [REDACTED])
- Redaction patterns: entire payload, multiple fields, conditional
- Limitations: top-level fields only, no nested/pattern support
- Common use cases: API keys, DB credentials, PII, env vars
- Best practices: priority rules, testing, fail-safe defaults
- Verification workflow with CLI examples

**Key Content:**
- 4 practical examples (API keys, DB, PII, env vars)
- 5 best practice guidelines
- Workarounds for nested field redaction
- CLI verification with jq

### 3. Budget Behavior & Tuning (## Budget Behavior & Tuning - line 4468)

**Documented:**
- Budget configuration: kb and lines limits
- How budgets are applied (event selection order)
- Budget consumption calculation
- Tuning guidelines: default/small/large/unlimited
- Budget exhaustion behavior
- Optimization strategies
- Budget monitoring with CLI

**Key Content:**
- 4 budget size presets with token estimates
- Budget exhaustion handling and truncation
- Optimization: reduce events, code frames, increase selectivity
- Monitoring with jq queries

### 4. Focus Overlays (## Focus Overlays - line 4641)

**Documented:**
- Key characteristics: non-persistent, override, independent, atomic
- Use cases: debugging, agent-driven, experiments, multi-tenant
- Workflow example with save/restore pattern
- Comparison table: persistent vs overlay rules

**Key Content:**
- Memory-only overlay system
- Practical debugging workflow
- Feature comparison with persistent rules

## Verification

All verification commands pass:

```bash
grep -n 'Rule pack' docs/testing/laminar.md
# Output: Line 4070

grep -n 'redaction' docs/testing/laminar.md  
# Output: 8 references across sections

grep -n 'overlay' docs/testing/laminar.md
# Output: 25 references across sections
```

## Success Criteria Met

✅ Rule pack documentation complete (3 packs: node-defaults, go-defaults, minimal)
✅ Redaction guidance complete (patterns, opt-outs, examples, limitations)
✅ Budget behavior documented (configuration, tuning, monitoring)
✅ Focus overlays explained (characteristics, use cases, workflow)
✅ Practical examples for each topic
✅ Best practices included throughout
✅ All topics documented and findable

## Deliverable

**File:** `patches/DIFF_T4204_docs-rulepacks-redaction.patch`
**Size:** 25KB (1070 lines)
**Location:** `/srv/repos0/mkolbol/patches/`
