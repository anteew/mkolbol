# No changes required

# The loader tests at tests/config/loader.spec.ts are already included
# in the test:ci command. Vitest's default discovery pattern picks up
# all *.spec.ts files, and the test:ci script runs with --pool=threads
# which is the correct lane for these tests.
#
# Verification: npm run test:ci shows "✓ should parse valid YAML" and
# "✓ should parse valid JSON" along with other loader test cases.
