# DUPLICATE OF T6004

T7012 requested mapping health failures to exit codes in mkctl.

This was already implemented in T6004 (see patches/DIFF_T6004_mkctl-health-exit.patch).

The implementation includes:
- Health check failure detection in mkctl.ts
- Exit code 70 (RUNTIME) for health check failures
- Test coverage in mkctlRun.spec.ts
- Documentation in mkctl-cookbook.md

**Status**: Already completed in T6004. No additional work needed.
